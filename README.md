# DatabaseInterface
A personal database interface with Python (Tkinter) and Sqlite3. It was made for a family entrepreneurship.

### With this application, you can:  
- Create/Find/Delete sales. 
- Monthly/Yearly/Daily stadistics. 

### A quick tour into folders and files in this project: 
- _"COPIA DE SEG"_ -> A backup folder of different versions with date.
- _"Img"_ -> That folder contains images required for the app.
- _\_\_pycache\_\__ -> Simply ignore.
- _build/UI_ -> Files generated when building this database interface.
- _dist/UI_ -> Files generated for the distribution of the app. It has a "UI.exe" file, which is the app.
- _"Proyecto3.png"_ -> A simply image, showing the database interface.
- _"UI.py"_ -> Python file which contains the entire code.
- _"UI.py"_ -> Ignore.
- _art001_ -> Is the database file, created by Sqlite3. This contains the sale's data.
